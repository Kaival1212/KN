                        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">In today's digitally-driven world, choosing the right platform for your business can make or break user engagement and long-term success. Should you invest in a native mobile app or lean on a responsive web app? This guide will walk you through the critical factors to consider, helping you make an informed decision that aligns with your goals and budget.</p>

                        <h2 className="mt-12 text-2xl font-semibold">1. User Experience & Performance</h2>
                        <p>Native mobile apps are built specifically for iOS and Android, giving them direct access to device hardware—like the camera, GPS, and sensors. This translates to smoother animations, faster load times, and an overall richer user experience.</p>
                        <p>By contrast, web apps run in a browser. They’re excellent for broad compatibility but may suffer in speed and offline performance. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) bridge this gap by offering offline caching and home-screen install prompts, making them a strong middle ground.</p>

                        <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">2. Development & Maintenance Costs</h2>
                        <p>One of the biggest advantages of web apps is that you build once and deploy everywhere. A single development team can maintain one codebase, reducing ongoing costs.</p>
                        <p>Conversely, native apps require separate codebases (Swift/Kotlin or cross-platform tools), which can double maintenance overhead. If your budget is tight, a PWA or responsive web app might be the most cost-effective route.</p>

                        <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">3. Reach & Accessibility</h2>
                        <p>Web apps are instantly accessible via URLs—no app store approvals or downloads required. This lowers the barrier to entry, especially for first-time visitors or users on unfamiliar devices.</p>
                        <p>Mobile apps, housed in app stores, can drive organic discovery through search rankings and featured placements. However, convincing users to download an app can be a hurdle without strong brand recognition.</p>

                        <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">4. Monetization & Distribution</h2>
                        <p>Native platforms unlock in-app purchases, subscriptions, and push notifications—powerful tools for engagement and revenue.</p>
                        <p>Web apps rely on traditional web monetization: subscriptions, ads, or paid access. They can also integrate payment platforms like Stripe for seamless transactions.</p>

                        <h2 className="mt-10 text-2xl font-semibold">5. Scalability & Long-Term Strategy</h2>
                        <p>If you anticipate rapid feature expansion—like AR experiences or advanced offline functionality—native development offers the flexibility you need.</p>
                        <p>For businesses prioritizing speed-to-market and iterative testing, start with a PWA. Once you’ve validated your concept and user demand, you can invest in full-native builds with confidence.</p>
